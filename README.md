# Virtual-Calculator
My project is mainly focused in providing the users a mathematical program which will help him to solve various mathematical operations required in his day to day life. 
MY project along with scientific calculator consists of root finder, simultaneous equation solver, Complex calculator, Volume finder, Area finder, Derivative and integral calculator etc. This allows the student to solve various study related problems in an easier way. 
In a world where, people are moving towards virtual reality, our virtual calculator program allows the user to calculate using hand gestures. 
This project gave us an opportunity to research more on GUI applications and OpenCV module which enabled us to use the camera module and hand-detection module. 
Finally, a scientific calculator is a necessity now for each and every student and hence we think this project will attract more number of students to use it

# Why Virtual Calculator:
When a student sits to solve a problem the basic problems he faces are: 

• How to calculate complex arithmetical and trigonometric operations? 

• How to find integral and derivative of complex equations? 

• How to find roots of 3rd or 4th degree polynomial? 

• How to find Volumes or areas of different figures? Etc.

So our project is focused in providing solutions to these problems by integrating all these functionalities in a single program. This will allow the student to focus on solving the problem and not on performing complex calculations. This will also help the student to save his time and use it judicially. 

# Introduction:
Calculators have a wide scope of applications, being useful in many fields like science, technology, accounting, marketing, education, finances, etc, etc. Their accessibility depends on the user understanding basic mathematical concepts such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. 

Scientific calculators require a more advanced level of understanding from the user for their scientific functions. Calculators are ridiculously easy to obtain as they are available in hardware form in any supply store or supermarket, and also in software form in computers, smartphones, tablets, etc. . Highlighting features of our calculator are Simultaneous equation solver, Root finder , Volume finder, finding derivative and integral of a function, area finder and complex calculator for higher end of mathematical calculations.
